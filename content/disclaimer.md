Lakka is still under heavy development.

In its current state, the project allows you to play most games on most platforms.

However, expect bugs, missing features or features not working as intended, and hardware that is yet to be supported.

If you find a bug, you can declare it in our [tracker](<%= @config[:links][:github] %>/issues), unless already reported.

You can also get help from the community. The developers are busy developing! :)

We need help to improve our documentation, so if you believe you can contribute, please get in touch with us.
