 - PPSSPP fixed

 - Kernel update for the Odroid XU4

## What's next?

I've been exploring porting Lakka to LibreELEC 9 port, and have made significant progress on a new libretro frontend called [Ludo](https://github.com/libretro/ludo) with an extensible menu system.

I'd like to thanks all the libretro contributors who have made this new release possible, while I was busy taking care of a young baby.

Best wishes for 2019 and happy retro gaming!
