## Recording

For new installs, recorded videos will be saved in `/storage/recordings` accessible via SAMBA share `Recordings`. If you update from earlier version, RetroArch will by default save videos to `/storage/.config/retroarch/records`, which is also accessible via SAMBA share `Configfiles` &rarr; `retroarch` &rarr; `records`. You can change the default path for saving videos via `Settings` &rarr; `Directory` &rarr; `Recordings`. Please, bear in mind that this feature is demanding, especially when using GPU recording (3D cores). It may not work with every core. Please see [RetroArch bug tracker](https://github.com/libretro/RetroArch/issues?page=1&q=recording+is%3Aopen) for any existing issues with recording.


### Config file for recording

Currently it is possible only to use software encoder. Use the below configuration and store it as e.g. `Software.cfg` in the following path:

- directly on the SD card/drive when connected to a computer:
  - on Switch (works also when connected as mass storage): `/lakka/storage/.config/retroarch/records_config`
  - on other devices: `LAKKA_DISK:/.config/retroarch/records_config` (may require superuser privileges to access this path / write files here)
- via SAMBA share `Configfiles` &rarr; `retroarch` &rarr; `records_config`
- via SSH/SFTP access to the filesystem: `/storage/.config/retroarch/records_config`

Configuration file contents:

    vcodec = libx264
    acodec = libmp3lame
    pix_fmt = yuv420p
    scale_factor = 2
    threads = 3
    video_crf = 25
    video_preset = superfast
    video_tune = animation
    audio_global_quality = 75
    sample_rate = 44100
    format = flv
