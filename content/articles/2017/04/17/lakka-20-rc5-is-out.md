Users of the stable release of December 2016 will have to reinstall from scratch. Advanced users can also attempt a manual upgrade by placing the TAR in the Update folder.

Please remember that even though we are close to a stable release, these builds are still a Release Candidate designed for testers.

Thank you all for using Lakka!
