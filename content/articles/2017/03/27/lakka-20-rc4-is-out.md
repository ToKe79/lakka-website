## Installing or upgrading

You can find the latest OS images here: [https://le.builds.lakka.tv/](https://le.builds.lakka.tv/).

Users of Lakka 2.0 RC1, RC2 or RC3 can upgrade directly from the graphical interface.

Users of the stable release of December 2016 will have to reinstall from scratch. Advanced users can also attempt a manual upgrade by placing the TAR in the Update folder.

Please remember that even though we are close to a stable release, these builds are still a Release Candidate designed for testers.

Thank you all for using Lakka!
