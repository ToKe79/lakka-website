Last month, I worked hard with our contributor **@Ntemis** to add support for single board computers powered by the **H3 CPU**.

The newly supported boards are:

 * Orange Pi 2
 * Orange Pi Lite
 * Orange Pi One
 * Orange Pi PC
 * Orange Pi PC+
 * Orange Pi Plus
 * Orange Pi Plus 2E
 * Banana Pi M2+
 * Beelink X2

As you can see, the H3 is used in a lot of boards. Each of them have different specs, and some of them are available at a very cheap price.

The original OpenELEC and LibreELEC port was completed by **@jernejsk** and we backported it to Lakka.

The images can be downloaded from [there](https://mirror.lakka.tv/nightly/). **@Ntemis** took care of testing the images on some of these boards, and Lakka and RetroArch are working well on them.

If you are new to Lakka and want to test one of the images, just adapt the installation instruction that you can find on our website for any other ARM board.

As I don't own any of these boards myself, so I can't check them for regressions and support them officially at the moment. I, however, will as soon as some contributors send me one or two.

We need more owners of any of these boards on our IRC chan to check if all the images are really working correct. Remember that this is mainly untested work, just something to keep in mind when you report bugs. 

As always, thanks for your support :)
