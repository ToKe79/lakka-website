[SolidRun](https://www.solid-run.com/) sent us two new devices: a Cubox-i4 and an HummingBoard-i2eX. Many thanks to them.

So Lakka is being ported to these and the result is already very promising. They can both run snes9x-next smoothly, pcsx_rearmed, and sometimes vba-next.

There are still some rough edges that need to be polished before release, but you can already grab a nightly build from [here](https://sources.lakka.tv/nightly).

Feel free to try it and report bugs you find!
