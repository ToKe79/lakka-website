## Network setup

The Odroid Go Advance (version 1), Odroid Go Super as well as some revisions of
the RG351P do not provide built-in Wifi connectivity. In order to connect to a
network you will need a WiFi USB adapter (or any other USB network adapter,
like a USB-Ethernet device).

You might wanna just transfer games directly to the SD card by using any
of the [alternative methods](/doc/Accessing-Lakka-filesystem).
