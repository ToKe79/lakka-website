## Adding and launching a game

### Adding a game using network share

Your Lakka Box and your Computer must be connected to the same Network. Please use an Ethernet wire or configure the Wi-Fi connection. You also need to enable SAMBA in Settings->Services:

Open Finder.

In the left column, you should see a *LAKKA* icon.  
If LAKKA is there, clicking on it will lead you to a list of folders:

Copy your games under the **roms** folder. This step can take some time, as the games are transferred to the Lakka Box through your local network.

It is a good idea to start testing a Super Nintendo game, because they require no BIOS to run.

We recommend games from the **no-intro** sets, because they are clean, tested, and will scan properly.

### Scanning your games

Using your joypad, go to the last tab with the + icon.

Choose the directory to scan. If you added your game directly to the *roms* folder, then just choose **Scan This Directory**.

Yellow messages will appear at the bottom of the screen, informing you about the progress of the scanning task.

Once finished, you will see a new tab at the right end of the menu.

### Launching a game

Go to the new tab you just created. You should see your games in the list.

Select the rom you want to run:

The game should be starting:
