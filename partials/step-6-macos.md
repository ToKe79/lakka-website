<h2>Adding and launching a game</h2>

<h3>Adding a game using network share</h3>

<p>Your Lakka Box and your Computer must be connected to the same Network. Please use an Ethernet wire or configure the Wi-Fi connection. You also need to enable SAMBA in Settings &rarr; Services:</p>

<p><img src="/images/lakkamenuenablesamba.png" alt="Enabling SAMBA" /></p>

<p>Open Finder.</p>

<p>In the left column, you should see a <em>LAKKA</em> icon.<br />
If LAKKA is there, clicking on it will lead you to a list of folders:</p>

<p><img src="/images/macossamba1.png" alt="Share" /></p>

<p>Copy your games under the <strong>roms</strong> folder. This step can take some time, as the games are transferred to the Lakka Box through your local network.</p>

<p>It is a good idea to start testing a Super Nintendo game, because they require no BIOS to run.</p>

<p>We recommend games from the <strong>no-intro</strong> sets, because they are clean, tested, and will scan properly.</p>

<h3 id="scanning-your-games">Scanning your games</h3>

<p>Using your joypad, go to the last tab with the + icon.</p>

<p>Choose the directory to scan. If you added your game directly to the <em>roms</em> folder, then just choose <strong>Scan This Directory</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lakkamenuscan.png" alt="Scanning content" /></p>

<p>Yellow messages will appear at the bottom of the screen, informing you about the progress of the scanning task.</p>

<p>Once finished, you will see a new tab at the right end of the menu.</p>

<h3 id="launching-a-game">Launching a game</h3>

<p>Go to the new tab you just created. You should see your games in the list.</p>

<p><img src="/images/lakkamenufindrom.png" alt="Browse roms" /></p>

<p>Select the rom you want to run:</p>
